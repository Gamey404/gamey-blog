What I am referring to is Matrix support on Linux phones and with that push notifications which essentially don&amp;rsquo;t exist in the current GNU/Linux ecosystem but are a essential component for a good Smartphone. I am probably not the only one who got frustrated by the current state more then once and possibly even lost hope altogether but there is a light at the end of a long tunnel and that&amp;rsquo;s what I want to show you in this article!</description></item></channel></rss>
