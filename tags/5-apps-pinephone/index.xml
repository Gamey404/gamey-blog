You can find the last two posts linked down below if you are interested in more after this and as always the screenshots and testing where done on my 2GB Pinephone model in DanctNIX mobile Archlinux.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>PINEPHONE: 5 amazing Linux phone apps!

I think I will make a series out of this because I like to do it and apparently people like to read it. As always all of my testing is done on my 2GB Pinephone with DanctNIX Arch Linux.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>PINEPHONE: 5 amazing Linux phone Apps!</title><link>https://gamey.tech/posts/pinephone-5-amazing-linux-phone-apps/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gamey.tech/posts/pinephone-5-amazing-linux-phone-apps/</guid><description>&lt;p>Today I thought I would make a small list with some of the in my opinion best Pinephone apps. As always it&amp;rsquo;s done on DanctNIX Arch with Phosh and my 2GB Pinephone and since I don&amp;rsquo;t have a Librem5 I can&amp;rsquo;t say anything specific about it but most of the apps should work across all true mobile GNU/Linux Phones.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
