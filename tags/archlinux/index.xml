As one of the last truly free media formats Podcasts are a perfect match with devices like the Pinephone and it&amp;rsquo;s also what I enjoyed most of in terms of content formats on mine. I have to admit that I never really was into Podcasts but lately I discovered that one of my favorite newspapers (Der Falter) has one and from there it just went on with my all time favorite Darknet Diaries which is just fantastic, the Pinetalk and the PostmarketOS podcast. I bet I will discover many more in the future because now I am hooked!&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
