My name is Nils, as a hobby I write little blog posts under the nick Gamey. They are mostly about the Pinephone, but I also like other FOSS projects and plan to write about desktop Linux, Possibly a bit of FOSS Android and other FOSS related stuff here to. I am a supporter of free software, right to repair and politically more left leaning but not a specially big fan of the "social justice" circus. Other then that I am not specially interesting and my dayjob has nothing to do with computers.
