It&amp;rsquo;s not at all hard to do but you have to know what to do and since I found no proper guide or anything about this except for a environment variable list by Peter from linmob I thought I would make my own.</description></item><item><title>PINEPHONE: 5 amazing Linux phone apps!

You can find the last two posts linked down below if you are interested in more after this and as always the screenshots and testing where done on my 2GB Pinephone model in DanctNIX mobile Archlinux.

As one of the last truly free media formats Podcasts are a perfect match with devices like the Pinephone and it&amp;rsquo;s also what I enjoyed most of in terms of content formats on mine. I have to admit that I never really was into Podcasts but lately I discovered that one of my favorite newspapers (Der Falter) has one and from there it just went on with my all time favorite Darknet Diaries which is just fantastic, the Pinetalk and the PostmarketOS podcast.</description></item><item><title>PINEPHONE: 5 amazing Linux phone apps!

I think I will make a series out of this because I like to do it and apparently people like to read it. As always all of my testing is done on my 2GB Pinephone with DanctNIX Arch Linux.
Tubefeeder: ðŸ”—Tubefeeder is something in between a feed reader and Youtube client made with GTK and written in Rust.</description></item><item><title>Browsers on the Pinephone.</title><link>https://gamey.tech/posts/browsers-on-the-pinephone./</link><pubDate>Sun, 25 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gamey.tech/posts/browsers-on-the-pinephone./</guid><description>Today I thought I would do a full rewrite of my Pinephone browsers post because it&amp;rsquo;s obviously a important peace on every phone specially with a limited app selection. I hope this is helpful to some of you and as always all my testing is done on my 2GB Pinephone with DanctNIX Arch Linux.
Firefox: ðŸ”—The browser I use by far the most and one that worked decent since I got my device.</description></item><item><title>My Pinephone Dailydriver setup.</title><link>https://gamey.tech/posts/my-pinephone-dailydriver-setup./</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gamey.tech/posts/my-pinephone-dailydriver-setup./</guid><description>Today I will talk a little about my personal Pinephone setup which I use as daily driver by now. Unlike on my testing setup where I just love DanctNIX Arch ARM in this case I chose PostmarketOS. The reason for that is it&amp;rsquo;s minimalist approach which fits perfect for a Alpine base and even better for a low end device like the Pinephone. The main advantage of Arch is the AUR and it&amp;rsquo;s always up to date packages which makes it perfect as a testing setup and for many of your probably also as daily driver but I tend to spend a lot of time for my daily driver setups to get them right once and then use them till I want to change something.</description></item><item><title>PINEPHONE: 5 amazing Linux phone apps!</title><link>https://gamey.tech/posts/pinephone-5-amazing-linux-phone-apps/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gamey.tech/posts/pinephone-5-amazing-linux-phone-apps/</guid><description>Today I thought I would make a small list with some of the in my opinion best Pinephone apps. As always it&amp;rsquo;s done on DanctNIX Arch with Phosh and my 2GB Pinephone and since I don&amp;rsquo;t have a Librem5 I can&amp;rsquo;t say anything specific about it but most of the apps should work across all true mobile GNU/Linux Phones.
Tootle: ðŸ”—Tootle is a simple GTK Mastodon client written in Vala.

Fractal is a awesome Matrix client for Gnome and Phosh but it currently lacks support for encryption and on Phosh it can&amp;rsquo;t open the Gnome Keyring (safe your login). Luckily there are workarounds for those two issues and those are what this post will focus on.</description></item></channel></rss>
